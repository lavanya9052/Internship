# Student Performance Analysis

## 1. Project Overview

This project aims to analyze the Student Performance Dataset and develop a predictive model for student pass/fail status. The analysis involves data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and the application of machine learning classification techniques. The goal is to identify key factors influencing student performance and build a model that can accurately predict academic outcomes.

## 2. Dataset



### 2.1. Description

The primary dataset used is "StudentsPerformance.csv," which contains student scores in mathematics, reading, and writing, along with various demographic, family, and school-related features.

### 2.2. Source

The dataset was obtained from \[Specify the source of the dataset here, e.g., UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle].

## 3. Files

### 3.1. Core Files

* `student_performance.ipynb`: This Jupyter Notebook contains the complete Python code for the data analysis, model training, and evaluation.
* `StudentsPerformance.csv`: The dataset file used in the analysis.
* `README.md`: This file, providing a comprehensive overview of the project, methodology, and results.

### 3.2. Supporting Files (If Applicable)

* \[Any other files, e.g., visualizations saved as images, preprocessed data files, etc.]

## 4. Libraries and Dependencies

The following Python libraries are essential for running the code in the `student_performance.ipynb` notebook:

* `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
* `numpy`: For numerical computations.
* `matplotlib`: For creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations.
* `seaborn`: For making statistical graphics.
* `scikit-learn`: For machine learning algorithms (Logistic Regression, Random Forest) and model evaluation metrics.

It is recommended to install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn
